# Mbrt_2018

Mandelbrot official website built in 2018.

This website was built using Brunch, specifically the Brunch + Babel/ES6 skeleton with the sass-brunch plugin. Following are the instructions to implement it.

## Dev Environment Setup

1. Clone this repo in your dev environment, you can simply run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/AndrewAlva/Mbrt_2018.git
```

2. Then install node modules through npm:
```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install
```

3. After that, make sure that the plugin 'sass-brunch' is installed, check inside the 'package.json', you should see inside the 'devDependencies' object the key 'sass-brunch'; if it's not there, then run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install --save-dev sass-brunch
```

And that's it; now you are able to work with this repo.
